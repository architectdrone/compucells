A rule string is a 512-bit representation of all 512 rules in a cellular automata. 
To get the next state of a cell from a rule string, convert the current state into an integer by treating the surrounding cells as bits, like surrounding
nw nc ne cw cc ce sw sc se
8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
This tells you what index in the rule string to go to.
